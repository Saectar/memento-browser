==1. What is a Memento?==
_A Memento is an archived version of a web page at a particular date._

==2. Where do these mementos come from?==
_There are a number of web archives like [http://archive.org/ Internet Archive], [http://www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa/ UK Web Archive], [http://www.webcitation.org/ WebCite], and others that supply mementos._

==3. Why isn't there a page for every day?==
_The Web is a very large place, and web archivists are not able to archive every web page every day._

==4. Why can't I always push the Now button?==
_If the web page you are viewing is the current version of the page the Now button will be disabled._

==5. Why do the pages look different sometimes?==
_There are several different archives that store Mementos and each on has a slightly different way of building their pages._

==6. Why don't all the pictures load on a page I am viewing?==
_When a page gets archived sometimes an element from the page (such as a picture) isn't archived properly._
