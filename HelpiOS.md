# Introduction #

Memento Browser allows you to to "time-travel" through the Web by showing you web pages as they used to look in the past. These older web pages are called "Mementos".

To see an older version of the web page you are currently viewing, click the **Date** button and select the date of the page you'd like to see. The browser will attempt to find a page that was archived on that precise date, and it will load the page with the closet date that it could find.

You can also use the **<** and **>** buttons to navigate to other archived versions of the web page. Or you may view all the archived versions available by selecting the **Mementos** option from the main menu.

If you're finished time-travelling and want to return to how the web page looks today, click the **Now** button on the navigation bar.

# Timegates #
You may add your own custom timegates by selecting **Settings** from the main menu and typing it into the text box or selecting it from the list below. It is recommended you not add your own timegates unless you really know what you are doing. The default timegate at mementoproxy.lanl.gov cannot be deleted.
